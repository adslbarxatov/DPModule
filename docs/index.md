## :gb: Hello, dear user!

We’re glad to welcome you to the start page of Free development lab (RD AAOW FDL).

We’re working (to the best of our ability) on quite different projects and share the latest news.
In addition, we publish results of developments, links to working tools and – in general – everything
that turns out to be useful. And not only for ourselves, but also for our colleagues: our communities
are open for thematic posts.

We’re sure that we will be able to offer you interesting and convenient solutions for typical
and specific tasks. Well, or just something entertaining and non-standard.
In addition, we will be glad to receive wishes and suggestions, as well as bug reports
(descriptions of found problems) on active projects.

We’re looking forward to a long and mutually beneficial cooperation!

A little about the rules:

- We take care of our colleagues. Therefore, a [Social communities policy](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/SCP)
was developed and introduced, which is binding on all participants. Please note that it is of a protective
and not restrictive nature.
- We are also concerned about the ideological values of our communities. Therefore, there is an
[Application development policy](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/ADP) that ensures compliance with all
published products and developments.

Both documents are required for familiarization for the most complete understanding of the goals
and objectives of the laboratory.

### UniNotifier :gb: :ru:
● [:earth_africa: About](https://github.com/adslbarxatov/uninotifier)
● [:film_projector: User guide](https://youtube.com/watch?v=HPq88MW3jF8)
● [:iphone: Get on Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RD_AAOW.UniNotifier)
● [:package: Get APK](https://github.com/adslbarxatov/UniNotifier/releases/latest/download/UniNotifier.apk)
● [:package: Get on DPModule](dp://UniNotifier)
● [:iphone: Get Tablepedia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RD_AAOW.TablepediaNotifier) ●

This utility provides the ability to receive notifications about changes in the state of user-specified sites
and their webpages (in other words, updates and news) in the form of a text log. In this case, only what the user
specified is loaded – all other objects (including advertisement) are ignored. Before starting work, it is recommended that you view its video presentation

&nbsp;

### Upsilon one :ru: :gb:
● [:earth_africa: VK](https://vk.com/upsilon_one)
● [:iphone: Get &#X03A5;1 client](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/DPModule/#uninotifier-gb-ru) ●

The **&#X03A5;1 community** is a conditional city (in the future, maybe something more). Each post in it is an independent resident
(character, entity) or object (building). Not necessarily completely unique, but very likely to have some unique features.

Each post is expected to have:
- Names, nicknames or titles. It is not a fact that all the inhabitants will be alive or even material, and the objects will be terrestrial.
- At least two universal characteristics – belonging (in games it is called a race; for objects it is called a class)
and specialization (profession, ability, task being solved). Being two text lines at the beginning of the description,
they can be filled with anything, depending on the nature of the description.
- Actually, descriptions: as concise as possible, but including the most striking features.

Universal characteristics are needed to enable text search in the city if it becomes large enough. In addition,
they can be useful when migrating to the second-level community in Telegram.

The third level, by the way, will be the ability to “walk along the street, meeting residents and passing by random buildings”.
For this, a special version of the UniNotifier application has already been created, ready to accept characters from
Upsilon one. Each press of a special button will allow you to familiarize yourself with a randomly selected description.

We assume that this idea will be of value primarily to writers and copywriters. But it can also be useful for game designers,
artists, and ordinary players and readers.

We hope that by joint efforts (we accept user publications) we will be able to create a fairly voluminous and interesting
project! And welcome to Upsilon one!
