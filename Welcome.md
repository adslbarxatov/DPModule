### Hello, dear user!

We’re glad to welcome you to the start page of Free development lab (RD AAOW FDL).

We’re working (to the best of our ability) on quite different projects and share the latest news.
In addition, we publish results of developments, links to working tools and – in general – everything
that turns out to be useful. And not only for ourselves, but also for our colleagues: our communities
are open for thematic posts.

We’re sure that we will be able to offer you interesting and convenient solutions for typical
and specific tasks. Well, or just something entertaining and non-standard.
In addition, we will be glad to receive wishes and suggestions, as well as bug reports
(descriptions of found problems) on active projects.

We’re looking forward to a long and mutually beneficial cooperation!

A little about the rules:

- We take care of our colleagues. Therefore, a [Social communities policy](https://github.com/adslbarxatov/scp)
was developed and introduced, which is binding on all participants. Please note that it is of a protective
and not restrictive nature.
- We are also concerned about the ideological values of our communities. Therefore, there is an
[Application development policy](https://github.com/adslbarxatov/adp) that ensures compliance with all
published products and developments.

Both documents are required for familiarization for the most complete understanding of the goals
and objectives of the laboratory.
