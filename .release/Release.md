_Changes for v 13.6.5_:
- Some code refactoring has been applied;
- Current improvements and updates have been accepted;
- Some tips have been updated;
- Found and fixed the bug that affected the file association method: right after the deployment (if “start after deployment” flag is set) this method created corresponding icons in the DPModule’s directory. This misplacement caused them to be invisible for users. The bug will not appear in versions of applications created after July 10, 2022;
- Fixed the text color of the modes list;
- Implemented the ability to create shortcuts in the Start menu (in addition to desktop shortcuts)
