- Packages viewer now has more suitable appearance;
- Implemented the ability to check missing requirements (.NET, C++ RTL, etc.) and download some of them or redirect user to the needed webpage;
- Improved the parser of the packages list;
- Implemented the deployment package v 14 that supports multilanguage descriptions, extendable flags sections and sets of controllable requirements;

- Implemented the ability to open localized ADP, SCP and Welcome pages;
- Required framework version updated from 4.0 to 4.8
