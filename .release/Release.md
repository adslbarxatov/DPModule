_Changes for v 12.6_:
- App will now automatically override deployment path in case of its absence (instead of blocking the deployment);
- Fixed some interface inconveniences and tips;
- Added protection against interrupted downloads: packages “shreds” will be removed automatically;
- Implemented ability to save specified deployment flags (creating shortcuts, kill process, etc.)
