_Changes for v 11.0_:
- Packages manager's interface has been completely rebuilt; now it's able to:
    - download packages, as before (packages statuses will be shown by icons);
    - clearly select packages for deploying (without 'open file' window);
    - display downloaded and previously deployed packages;
    - select packages for re-deployment;
    - clear cache, as before; 
- Removed multiple warnings about custom installation path; only one message will be shown for every app;
- Removed some artifacts of old versions;
- Added ability to 'ask developer' via E-mail for help, or send wish, advice or bug report; the same functionality has been removed from the main window;
- Added ability to create deinstallation scripts for installation (not an update) packages; scripts will be placed in 'Uninstallers' subdirectory
