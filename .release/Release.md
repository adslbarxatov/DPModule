_Changes for v 13.5.4_:
- Update packages are now able to create shortcuts;
- App will show updates availability (or “all packages are up to date” status), if no server messages have been received;
- The packages manager now has its tray icon. Its menu now contains “App about”, “Change UI language” and “Last server messages” options. The last one replaces the green rectangle used earlier for our alert messages
